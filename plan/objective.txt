I plan to make a two-dimensional, grid-based, space combat game.  It will be turn-based combat featuring different types of ships the players can buy that have unique characteristics, such as movemend range per turn, attack range, instant attack vs projectiles, etc.
My goal is to learn and fully implement sockets to enable real-time updating to both players any updates from the server on the current state of the game.  Ideally the games will be stored in their current state in a database so that players may asyncronously leave and rejoin a game to continue playing at a different time.
I would like to include a good amount of customizability and map randomization, with dynamic but symmetrical generation to ensure fair games.
I am currently not sure whether the players will start with a set amount of money to buy whichever ships they want, or if they will gain income over the course of the game from capturing objectives like mining asteroids.
